1
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,591
Courtney!

2
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,471
<i>I had this sensation of someone
taking my hand, guiding me...</i>

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,991
<i>I looked up and I saw this light.</i>

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,031
<i>The giant wall of light. Brighter...</i>

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,711
<i>All of a sudden, I was in a different place.</i>

6
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,870
<i>Pure energy.</i>

7
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>I fail to find words that can describe
what I experienced.</i>

8
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,360
<i>At that point,
I had that out-of-body experience.</i>

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,433
<i>I remember a feeling
of being sucked backwards,</i>

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,314
<i>like being pulled through water.</i>

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,312
<i>I wasn't having thoughts of my own.</i>

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,360
<i>Answers, messages coming through me.</i>

13
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,956
<i>Colors were so vivid.
Colors I've never seen before.</i>

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,158
<i>Then I was pushed right back into my body.</i>

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,279
<i>I could actually see my body from above,</i>

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,272
<i>like it was lifeless.</i>

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,396
<i>And I was floating up...</i>

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,836
<i>Everything I thought was important was</i>

19
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,470
<i>dwarfed by this sense of love.</i>

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,074
<i>And I could feel this pull,</i>

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,234
<i>a force trying to drag me down
this black tunnel.</i>

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,396
<i>Where is it taking me?</i>

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,514
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,239
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,834
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,640
<i>Something I did.</i>

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,752
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,399
Hello, Lauren.

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,279
How are you feeling?

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,313
You had a seizure tonight.

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,434
You're at Trinity Emmanuel Medical Center.

32
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,993
Lauren,

33
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,072
do you know that your heart stopped?

34
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
You were gone for several minutes,

35
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,272
but the trauma team brought you back.

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,031
Do you remember any of that?

37
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,358
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,397
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
She's in here.

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,674
We're taking you to Imaging. You'll be okay.

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,119
One for transfer in five.

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,833
Ready? One, two, three.

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,035
Transfer from Holy Cross.

44
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,351
38-year-old construction
worker, fell off a beam.

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,352
Persistent coma. GCS 6.

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
I'll page the resident.

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Already done. I got this.

48
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,236
- Which one of you is in charge here?
- It's my intake.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,352
Actually, I'm the one on duty.

50
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,797
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,672
Standard procedure for a GCS 6 admit

52
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,514
calls for two large-bore IVs
and diazepam on standby.

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,795
Seizure meds won't do any good.

54
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

55
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,432
And what medical protocol are you citing?

56
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,155
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,551
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,234
Actually, he's on seizure meds,

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,119
which is the medical protocol
of reading his chart.

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,835
Shit. No, no, no.

61
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,636
- Shit.
- What is it?

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,190
Respiratory failure.

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,310
He might be hemorrhaging.

64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,154
Page Neurosurgery, call a code,
and get CT on standby.

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,230
Students, clear the room.

66
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,393
Hey. What is it? What's wrong?

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,278
Did you know that there's 12 pairs of nerves

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,192
just within the cranial area?

69
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,560
The oculomotor, the trochlear,
the glossopharyngeal, and...

70
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,315
Nine others whose names I cannot remember.

71
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,756
I cannot absorb any more terminology.

72
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,398
I have, like, a rash on my arm.
I can't sleep.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,354
You know, my mother invested

74
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,399
her entire life savings into my education.

75
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,994
Come on.

76
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,231
Come on, that's enough suffering
for one night.

77
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,951
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

78
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,149
It's cold.

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,630
We used to be friends, right?

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,598
- What is...
- Like, our first year,

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,990
when we would sit together at lecture.
Remember?

82
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
And we'd, like, go running and get coffee.

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,039
Hang out. Do stuff.

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,554
We're still friends, though.

85
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,757
No, we don't talk.

86
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,674
We just work and compete.

87
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,559
Who's the fastest to make
a diagnosis of Bell's palsy?

88
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Quick, what's the seven
side effects of Ativan?

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,309
You know, just last week,
a second-year committed suicide.

90
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,876
God, Court, you're gonna be
such a good doctor.

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,316
Medicine just, like, comes easy to you.

92
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,234
You know, I think there's a way that
we could spend more time together.

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,959
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm just wondering

94
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,440
if you'd help me on this little, like,

95
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,916
extracurricular project I've been working on.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,671
We have neuro shelf exams in, like, 10 days.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,911
I don't really feel like I'm gonna make it.

98
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,871
Oh, Once One Takes The Anatomy Final,
Very Good Vacations Are Heavenly.

99
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,874
- What?
- It's a mnemonic phrase.

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,791
You use it to remember the 12 cranial nerves.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,633
You're welcome.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,274
But, yeah, I really would love your help.

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,754
Maybe.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,710
Hey.

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,838
What's in those?

107
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
First one's Mountain Dew laced with Adderall.

108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,393
Other's a chaser of espressos.

109
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,035
- Together, it's a liquid heart attack.
- Hey, Jamie.

110
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,594
Jesus.

111
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,959
Hey.

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,793
"Hey, Jamie." Where were you last night?

113
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,477
Your eyes are still dilated.

114
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,917
25-year-old female, admitted last night.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,913
Complaining of numbness on left side,
nausea, vomiting.

116
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,710
Anything of note from the physical exam?

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,550
Sees the color red differently between
left and right eye, and oral ulcers.

118
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,434
Sophia, what test should we run?

119
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600
A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,878
Fine, but reverse the order.
Images first, then procedure.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,469
Preliminary diagnosis, Brad.

122
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,040
- Pituitary cyst?
- No.

123
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,270
Jamie.

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,470
Jackie.

125
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,473
- Stroke?
- My God.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,520
You need to do better than this.

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,590
All of you.

128
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,390
What do you think the largest
age demographic is in our society today?

129
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,276
You.

130
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,079
Young adults in their 20s, which means

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,431
that there are at least 1,000 people waiting

132
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,159
to take your spot.

133
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,550
And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,599
nor do we waste our time
on students who think

135
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,832
that they can skate by
doing the least work necessary.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,073
We are here to educate students
who push themselves,

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,755
those who are capable
of making new discoveries

138
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,151
and actually move the dial
on human knowledge.

139
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,391
And for those of you who think
that's too much,

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,438
then you should leave.

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,029
And by that, I mean now.

142
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,359
Marlo, if I were to tell you

143
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,875
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

144
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,351
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,512
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

146
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,995
It's Behcet's disease.

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,759
Thank you, Ray.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,514
Moving on.

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,552
Why are you working this event?

150
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,197
You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

151
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,357
Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

152
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,920
I've been trying to meet.

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,994
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

154
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,873
and their golf games.

155
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,874
I don't think it's such a bad life.

156
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,550
I don't know about you,

157
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,759
but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,678
No one pays their dues anymore.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,672
Our generation,
it's all about entrepreneurship.

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,359
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

161
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm going to LA.

162
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,476
Look at this face.

163
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,756
I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper
of celebrity medicine.

164
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,716
Okay.

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,835
"Hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

166
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,235
That's funny. Cool. Okay.

167
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,312
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

168
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,633
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,309
Hey, come on, look.

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,756
- My station is full.
- Okay.

171
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,035
You're so behind.

172
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,876
Okay, sir, got to give you a testicular exam.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,719
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

174
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a minute.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,990
I don't enjoy it either.

176
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,152
Just close your eyes and pretend
I'm the candy-stripe girl.

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
What? Get, get the hell off of me!

178
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,830
Hold on.

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,320
- Candy-stripe girl.
- Get...

180
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,797
- No, wait a minute.
- Stop! What are you doing?

181
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,673
He doesn't need a testicular exam.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,750
He doesn't?

183
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,391
Come near me again, and I'm killing you.

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,393
You know, I think I got mixed up.

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,431
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,829
I can't imagine how I passed
the wrong information to you.

187
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,719
Very funny.

188
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
Ray can be a real dick sometimes.
You guys notice that?

189
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
I think he's intriguing.

190
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,836
Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
Every bed in the unit is full,
and we got referrals waiting in the ER.

192
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,599
Get moving on afternoon rounds.

193
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,873
Excuse me.

194
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,473
Do you have plans tonight?

195
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,676
First-years are having a wingding.

196
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,231
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

197
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,352
I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

198
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,716
Those guys have access to the best drugs.

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,510
Looking for this?

200
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,435
Hell yeah.

201
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,712
I found it on my nightstand.

202
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
See you later.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,316
These second-years have no tact,

204
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,279
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,953
Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

206
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,279
I mean, we have fun together.

207
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,036
Yeah, kinda.

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,717
Do you want to have fun with me later?

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,513
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,791
to be having this conversation with you.

211
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,399
But offer accepted.

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,837
Midnight, basement, sub level C.

213
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,753
You want to meet me in the basement?

214
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,317
Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

215
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,278
And take the service elevator,

216
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,676
'cause it doesn't have surveillance cameras.

217
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,191
Yeah. Good idea.

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,589
No.

219
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,270
Jesus!

220
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,350
You're late.

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,674
What are we doing down here?

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,832
Come on, we don't have much time.

223
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,999
Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

224
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,756
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

225
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,913
We're almost there, okay?

226
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,519
What is all of this?

227
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,439
They put this in five years ago.

228
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,035
In case of a natural disaster, loss of power.

229
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,353
It's a fully functioning hospital,
and it never gets used.

230
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,071
Court, what exactly are you up to?

231
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,990
Two of you.

232
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,196
Jamie, what are you doing here?

233
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,791
She didn't tell me about you either, okay?

234
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,031
But, I'm open to a three-way.

235
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,196
Shut up.

236
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
What?

237
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,954
I like it.

238
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

239
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,634
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

240
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,872
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

241
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,869
You mean we're not getting it on?

242
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,474
Wait, what are you talking about?

243
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,598
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

244
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,149
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

245
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,554
And these are postmortem scans

246
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,871
of patients that have died in this hospital.

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,078
Is there any circumstance under which

248
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,594
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

249
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,594
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

250
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,155
why doesn't it just go dark and shut off

251
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,390
at the moment of death?

252
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
You know, why the floating?

253
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,390
Why the white light?

254
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
Why the sense of well-being?

255
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,318
I mean, what is that experience?

256
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,111
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,637
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

258
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,360
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

259
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,155
What do you mean?

260
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,193
Nothing happens. We're dead.

261
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,239
What if we could prove otherwise?

262
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,033
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

263
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,834
And forget about Dr. Oz.

264
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,470
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

265
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,430
Okay, you got my attention.

266
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,639
Come on. This isn't science.

267
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,114
This is pseudoscience.

268
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

269
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,271
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

270
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,837
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

271
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,239
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

272
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,631
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

273
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,156
You give it one minute,
and then you bring me back.

274
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,350
Wait, you're serious?

275
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,440
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

276
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,313
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

277
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,754
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

278
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,634
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

279
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,995
And once that happens,

280
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,312
you administer a defibrillator shock
to stop my heart.

281
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,950
Wait a sec.

282
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,472
Look, I've signed a release. It's in my bag.

283
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,069
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

284
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,875
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

285
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,634
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

286
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,197
Look, I'm young, okay?
I'm in excellent health.

287
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,234
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

288
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,478
So reviving me should be
very straightforward.

289
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,157
Look, it's 12:18 now.

290
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,914
I've checked the schedules
for security down here

291
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,509
and cleaning crews.

292
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,116
We have about 45 minutes,
so we should probably get going.

293
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,392
What? This is crazy.
No, count me out of this.

294
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,790
I am not helping you kill yourself.

295
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,239
Well, then you can stand by the door
and make sure nobody comes in.

296
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,317
Okay, remember, there's a magnet
in the scanner,

297
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,198
so no keys or metal in the room.

298
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,078
Look, we've got it.

299
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,231
Wait, Jamie,
what if you can't bring her back?

300
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,756
Then we burn her body, work out our alibi,

301
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,394
and pretend like nothing happened.

302
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,960
And make sure that the scanner's recording,

303
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,839
because if not,
then this whole exercise is pointless.

304
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
We're good to go.

305
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,670
Repeat back to me
the resuscitation procedure.

306
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,590
As soon as you're dead, I'll run the scanner.

307
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,712
At 60 seconds, I'll start pulling you out

308
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,792
by switching to the heating blanket.

309
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,271
When your core temp's back up
to 93 degrees, I'll start CPR.

310
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,995
Crash cart is standing by
with the epi and the defib.

311
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,198
Hello? Brain damage. You'll get brain damage.

312
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,754
Not if you resuscitate me in time.

313
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,078
Brain cells can survive without oxygen
for at least four minutes.

314
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,759
Okay.

315
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,116
Now is the point
where you say it's all a joke.

316
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,157
Okay, put the blanket on me.

317
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,794
Jamie, look at her. Come on, she's terrified.

318
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,991
It's just my body's
natural survival instincts.

319
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,760
I anticipated this.
I'm trying to block it out.

320
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,951
Okay.

321
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,919
And now I kill you.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,469
Come on, you'll both get expelled.
You'll go to prison.

323
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,114
Only if you blab about it.

324
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,919
Okay. We're really doing this.

325
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,553
See you later.

326
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,193
She's out.

327
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,272
Body temp's dropping.

328
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, look, Jamie,
we can stop right here, okay?

329
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,993
She sleeps it off, wakes up, and we just
pretend that we followed through with it.

330
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,797
If you can't handle this, then look away.

331
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,472
Fine. Yeah, Jamie, I'll just leave!

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,990
- Charging 200.
- Come on! This is wrong!

333
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,679
- Weren't you leaving?
- You're murdering somebody!

334
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,434
Yeah, I probably should've stayed in tonight.

335
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,277
Clear!

336
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,479
Oh, my God.

337
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,076
- She's...
- Dead.

338
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,554
I think.

339
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,431
Counting off 60 seconds.

340
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,758
Do you see any brain activity?

341
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,839
I mean, something's going on,
I'm not really sure what.

342
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,559
It's recording, isn't it?

343
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,875
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,272
- <i>Fifty-one, 52...</i>
- <i>Fifty-three...</i>

345
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,351
<i>Fifty-four, 55, 56, 57,</i>

346
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,832
fifty-eight, 59,

347
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,593
- sixty seconds.
- Get her out.

348
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,152
Okay. Okay. Okay.

349
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,270
Blanket's warming.

350
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,716
- What's her temp need to get to again?
- Doesn't matter. Hurry up.

351
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,439
Calm down.

352
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,400
- Charge 200.
- Wait!

353
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,318
Clear!

354
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,110
It's not working.

355
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,435
Of course it isn't.

356
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,273
Paddles are useless without a heart rhythm.

357
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,396
Didn't you listen to her?

358
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah, I was gonna write down all the steps...

359
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,434
Move! Just move.

360
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,279
Move!

361
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,595
Did we order an MRI on... Hey.

362
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,354
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I...

363
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,193
No, she needs an epi.

364
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,676
IV, you moron. God, it's already set up.

365
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,754
Just push the drug into the goddamn arm!

366
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
Calm down! I got this.

367
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,072
God.

368
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,954
It's not working. Try something else!

369
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
There is nothing else.

370
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,114
Well, I...

371
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,750
What the fuck?

372
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,830
It was an experiment.

373
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,633
She had us stop her heart,
and we can't get her back.

374
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,757
- How long has she been out?
- I don't know, a couple of minutes.

375
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,109
Look, I say we try the paddles.

376
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,192
No, no! Wait! Put them down.

377
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,313
I... Stop, stop.

378
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,631
Take over for Sophia
on the chest compressions.

379
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,315
Do them much harder,
get on top of her if it helps.

380
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,792
Sophia, put that cooling blanket on.
She's too warm.

381
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,113
Then charge the defib
all the way to 360 and stand by.

382
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,873
As soon as Jamie and I get you a heartbeat,

383
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,952
however fluttering,
you put those paddles on her

384
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,474
and give her full power.

385
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,199
The blanket. Come on.

386
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,637
Got to push a lot more epi
than what you've been doing.

387
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,158
Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going.

388
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,350
All right.

389
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Come on, Courtney.

390
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,269
She's hypoxic.

391
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,834
We need to intubate.

392
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,439
All right? Go!

393
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,555
Let's get it off.

394
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,950
Help me.

395
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,832
BVM.

396
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,800
All right.

397
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,919
Go, go, go, go.

398
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,994
Clear!

399
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,399
Courtney, can you hear me?

400
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,234
You're crazy, you know that?

401
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,871
- You called Ray?
- Were you getting it done?

402
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,794
Does somebody want to fill me in here?

403
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,876
It happened very gently.

404
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,036
Like, almost like an untethering.

405
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,755
And I floated to the ceiling.

406
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,312
I could see my body.
I could see Sophia and Jamie.

407
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,275
And then I could see
the roof of the hospital.

408
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,399
And I've never been up there.

409
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,597
How do you explain that?

410
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,036
I can't explain it.

411
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,439
Are you mad at us?

412
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,912
I don't know what to think

413
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,835
other than you're all pretty stupid.

414
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,912
She's lucky to be alive.

415
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,239
She's alive because of you.

416
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,112
What else happened?

417
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,993
Did you see a white light?

418
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,589
I wouldn't call it that. It was...

419
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,553
It was more like...

420
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,437
Pure energy.

421
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,470
And honestly,
it was kind of sexual, actually.

422
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,313
It was kind of sexual.

423
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,475
Guys, playback's ready.

424
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,433
Hey. Check this out.

425
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,435
Okay, look. We're counting up
from zero at the moment of death.

426
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Cognitive activity has ceased.

427
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,637
Your heart stopped. No breathing, no pulse.

428
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,717
We're 15 seconds in, and there.

429
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,395
Look at that.

430
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,991
Like a bolt of lightning
in your prefrontal cortex.

431
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,080
We might just be witnessing
the afterlife, people.

432
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,395
Okay.

433
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,239
Who knows what we're looking at?

434
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,555
We're not radiologists.

435
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
I mean, it could just be
residual electricity.

436
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,712
- You know, synapses shutting down.
- Okay, we're moving on.

437
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,674
So, you've been dead almost 40 seconds now,

438
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,190
and look.

439
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,116
This area lights up, the hippocampus.

440
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,709
- That's not the hippocampus.
- Of course it is.

441
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,675
That is the ventral tegmental area.

442
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,475
It's the oldest part of the brain,
governs thirst, hunger, love.

443
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,916
Okay, doctors, I'm glad you're having fun.

444
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,400
Got to get out of here.

445
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,550
Hey, Ray, come on.

446
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,994
Hey, no. Just let him go.

447
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,029
It's over. Her brain's just dark now.

448
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,673
- No.
- Look at that.

449
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,553
Wait. Amygdala.

450
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,555
That's the amygdala. Rage.

451
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,433
Stress. Emotional memory.

452
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
Whatever you were seeing,

453
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,596
this is just before we pulled you out.

454
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,595
Is she okay?

455
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,637
She's been sitting there
for, like, 10 minutes.

456
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,439
- Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,276
What do you think she's doing out there?

458
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,075
I hope she doesn't try to fly.

459
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,477
If there were brain chemicals released,

460
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,036
the aftereffects could still be
in her bloodstream.

461
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,552
I took LSD once.

462
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,038
I stayed awake for three days.

463
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,874
Shit.

464
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,274
I'm gonna go check on her.

465
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,960
Let's leave.

466
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,513
That's high.

467
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,269
Hey.

468
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,673
Are you okay?

469
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,838
I'm gonna bake some bread.

470
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,920
What's with the bread?

471
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,518
Courtney baked it. Six loaves, last night.

472
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,673
She remembered her grandmother's recipe.

473
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,952
Also, she ran 12 miles.

474
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,358
- Twelve miles?
- Let's begin.

475
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,796
We've been ramping up Michael Evergreen
with meds for ten hours,

476
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,752
and his epilepsy hasn't gotten any better.

477
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,160
Now he's developed a skin rash.

478
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,511
It's a mystery. The meds should be working.

479
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,276
Carbamazepine?

480
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,670
What?

481
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,434
Carbamazepine has an 11% chance
of reacting negatively

482
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,034
with lamotrigine, which is the other drug

483
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,998
- that Michael's on.
- Seriously?

484
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Good catch, Courtney.

485
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,434
Sophia, next case.

486
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,832
Adele Gunther. 44 years old.
Admitted with mild confusion.

487
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,040
Says her sister's an impostor,
she doesn't recognize her.

488
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,431
No history of trauma. Too young for dementia.

489
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
We're gonna send it out to Psychiatry for...

490
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,996
It's Capgras syndrome.

491
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,150
- Go on.
- Capgras is an impairment

492
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,277
of the brain's facial recognition center.

493
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,199
And a very rare diagnosis.

494
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,395
V.S. Ramachandran, in his book,
<i>Phantoms of the Brain,</i>

495
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,350
links frontal cortex dichotomies,
like this, to Capgras.

496
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,874
That's not on this year's syllabus.

497
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,318
Optional reading in my first year.

498
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,751
Well, that's more like it.

499
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,078
My sister loved this piece.

500
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,280
Drug warnings for carbamazepine
run 20 pages long.

501
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,710
How could she possibly
recall a detail like that?

502
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,713
How is she playing the piano again,
after 12 years?

503
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,873
She's not playing that well.

504
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,792
It's like her brain's been rewired,

505
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,475
accessing everything she's ever learned.

506
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,638
I don't care what happened to her.

507
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,070
This experiment needs to end right now.

508
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,551
I'm not gonna risk everything
for a morbid fascination you guys have.

509
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,554
You think you're all medical pioneers?

510
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,798
You're just a bunch of
rich kids screwing around,

511
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,111
before you become wealthy specialists

512
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,080
with your Ivy League bumper stickers
on your Mercedes.

513
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,880
I was with you until the end.

514
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,720
No one puts bumper stickers on a Mercedes.

515
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,990
I think we're way past parlor tricks here.

516
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,192
That does it. I'm going next.

517
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,113
- Okay.
- Tonight. I am.

518
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,913
And you're all gonna be there.

519
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,112
It's a good day to die.

520
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,912
No! No!

521
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,079
Jesus Christ.

522
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that what I looked like?

523
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,912
Yep. Exactly like that.

524
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,356
- I knew you'd show up.
- How long has he been under?

525
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,600
Forty-five seconds.

526
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,718
I thought you'd had it
with all this foolishness.

527
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,600
Jamie asked me to be here.

528
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,633
He wanted me to pull him out.

529
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,391
- Pause compressions.
- One, two, three...

530
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,233
- Still no heartbeat.
- Pushing epi.

531
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,920
- Come on, Jamie, wake up.
- He can't hear you.

532
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,194
Sophia, get ready to intubate.

533
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,397
Okay. I've never done this before,

534
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,800
- so just give me a second...
- Just do it!

535
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,877
Ray, relax. There's no need to panic.

536
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,039
Let's give the epi a second to work.

537
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,559
<i>Jamie...</i>

538
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,353
Clear!

539
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,514
Take it out, take it out.

540
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,112
Hey...

541
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,679
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

542
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,438
I need a drink.

543
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,512
Shots, shots, shots!

544
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,953
Yeah, come on.

545
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,509
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

546
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,190
What do you guys think about
taking this wall down?

547
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,749
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted a loft.

548
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,554
It's hailing! Courtney!

549
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,915
What?

550
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,360
Watch it.

551
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,470
This is crazy.

552
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,552
It's like they're on the same wavelength.

553
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,832
We should bottle flatlining,
sell it as a club drug.

554
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,957
Here. Use this.

555
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,479
- Hey, no, no.
- No, no, no.

556
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,353
Oh, my God.

557
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,034
This has been the strangest night of my life.

558
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,594
You going next, Ray?

559
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,712
What, flatlining? No way.

560
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,794
I'd bring you back out.

561
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,674
Maybe.

562
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,516
You have to admit, I was pretty good
with that defibrillator.

563
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,280
You were okay.

564
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,632
Would it kill you to admit that
I might be just as good a doctor as you?

565
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,075
I never said you were not.

566
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,152
Hey, Marlo, your brother's here.

567
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,151
You have no more experience
than the rest of us.

568
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
I do.

569
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,752
I was a firefighter in Houston.

570
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,399
Almost six years.

571
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,878
I'm going next.

572
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,518
<i>It was super fun.</i>

573
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,514
I was all-powerful.
I had the whole city to myself.

574
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,718
It's weird, isn't it?

575
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,237
I thought there'd be more people, like...

576
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,518
Aren't you supposed to see...

577
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,398
Family members who've died, or...

578
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,594
Maybe there's no one there
because it wasn't really our time.

579
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,359
Was it all fun?

580
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,350
What do you mean?

581
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,474
I don't... I mean, like,
was there anything disturbing or...

582
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,752
Not really.

583
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,914
Why?

584
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,676
Nothing.

585
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,753
She's stabilizing.

586
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,355
I don't understand,
the data shows her starting

587
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,676
into a massive seizure,
and then it just went away.

588
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,919
I gave her Ativan.

589
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,913
On whose authority?

590
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,909
I'm sorry. I'll get approval next time.

591
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,394
You saved her life.

592
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,274
Yes, I did.

593
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,715
I'm Jesus.

594
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,835
Everyone I touch today, I'm gonna heal.

595
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,795
You know, it's funny,
because you and Courtney both flat...

596
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,715
You both flatlined,

597
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,275
yet Courtney is focused on the past,

598
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,399
memories, recipes.

599
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,032
Whereas you, you're focused on
the present, using your intuition.

600
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,550
What does that have in common with Courtney?

601
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,199
Sophia, Marlo, you're needed in the ICU.

602
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,999
It's an awakening.

603
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,034
See you later, Jesus.

604
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,396
- An awakening?
- Yeah.

605
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,960
You here for the abortion?

606
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,592
Should Ernesto La Paz get morphine?

607
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,755
I'll check with the resident.

608
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,472
Sophia? Where are you going?

609
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,310
It's 11:30 at night.

610
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,437
You're not on call,
and you don't have anything scheduled.

611
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,159
No, I'm going to the library.

612
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,430
I'm just gonna do some more studying.

613
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,550
No, no, no, no.

614
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,916
I'm making tea,
and we're gonna start reviewing

615
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,719
all of the terminology
for the nervous system.

616
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,315
- But I...
- Now.

617
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,790
Okay.

618
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,316
Where's Sophia?

619
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,517
We need to start. It's already 12:15.

620
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,239
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

621
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,198
The anesthesia will take care of that.

622
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,036
Three minutes.

623
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,600
Well, Jamie only did two.

624
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,670
What can I say?

625
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,870
I'm competitive.

626
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,000
After my three minutes are done,

627
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,595
these are the interventions I want,
in their specific order.

628
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,431
If I don't come out right away,
I want you to intubate me.

629
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,353
Force the oxygen, okay?

630
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,477
Hey, I'm gonna bring you out of it.

631
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,516
Relax. Enjoy the experience.

632
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,795
Okay, okay.

633
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,920
Infusion's flowing.

634
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,556
She's out. Body temp's 94.

635
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,160
Charging 200.

636
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,676
Clear.

637
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,876
Asystole.

638
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,471
38-year-old male,
stung in the face by a jellyfish.

639
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,080
...by a jellyfish.

640
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,273
That's it. Let's get her out.

641
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,110
Epi in.

642
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,633
- <i>Defib!</i>
- <i>Charge to 200.</i>

643
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,996
Clear.

644
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,392
- No pulse.
- Damn it, we just had it.

645
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,556
Juice her again.

646
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,998
I'm gonna push an epi and sodium bicarb.

647
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,239
<i>Defib. She's not stabilizing.</i>

648
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,029
<i>Charge 300.</i>

649
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,952
Clear. Come on.

650
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,116
No pulse.

651
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,477
This is not working. I need to intubate.

652
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,713
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

653
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,120
Calm down. I got this.

654
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,993
<i>360. Clear.</i>

655
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,510
Please.

656
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,989
She's back.

657
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,673
You good? You're all right.

658
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,558
- Yeah.
- There you go.

659
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,197
We're safe. No one ever comes up here.

660
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,672
- It's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

661
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,309
Her temp's low.

662
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,035
Pulse still racing.

663
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,393
Well, I think three minutes is too long.

664
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,233
Look, she had a bad trip, it happens.

665
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,516
What, you're an expert?

666
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,953
Yeah, more than you.

667
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,352
- Is she okay?
- Where have you been?

668
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,438
- Marlo is fine.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

669
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,075
I'm going next. Right now.

670
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,160
- Right now?
- Why not?

671
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,870
The cleaning crew is gonna be
down there in like 20 minutes.

672
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,879
- Okay.
- No, we've gone too far.

673
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,196
No more flatlining.

674
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,277
Okay, so you three get to
expand your consciousness

675
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,392
and get academic advantage, but I don't?

676
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,470
Advantage.

677
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,914
You think this makes you better, Sophia?

678
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,110
This makes you dead.

679
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,589
You have much more sense than that.

680
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,151
Ray, if this bothers you so much,
then just walk away.

681
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,277
- Well, maybe I should.
- You're not going anywhere.

682
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,317
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.

683
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,916
Okay, look,
I don't care how dangerous this is.

684
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,474
I need this more than any of you guys.

685
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,352
Ray, it's her decision.
Just like it was each of ours.

686
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,310
If Sophia wants to do this,
then we're doing it tonight.

687
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,194
Just don't stay in too long.

688
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,356
<i>A B-plus on a biology exam is not acceptable.</i>

689
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,590
<i>Not acceptable.</i>

690
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,070
<i>That will not get you into
a top-10 medical school.</i>

691
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,109
Someone's coming down the elevator.

692
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,236
- What?
- Get her out.

693
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,310
Come on, come on, come on.

694
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,349
Let's go. Let's go!

695
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,796
Pushing an amp of epi.

696
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,269
Where the hell are you going?

697
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,154
Start compressions.

698
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,074
Please, God, bring her back.

699
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,630
Good thinking, Doctor.

700
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,949
I'm sure that's gonna help.

701
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,390
Epi in.

702
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,470
Pause compressions.

703
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,670
Clear.

704
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,750
Irina.

705
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,318
<i>You are not the only kid
that is out there trying to get in.</i>

706
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,036
Shit.

707
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,319
One, two, three.

708
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,312
- V-tach.
- Charging 360.

709
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,870
Clear.

710
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,158
We got her, we got her.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

711
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,554
We're gonna get you out of here.

712
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,910
You're gonna be okay.

713
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,516
- Come on, you'll be okay. Come here.
- Come on.

714
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,273
- Come on!
- I got her, I got her.

715
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,950
- My jacket, my jacket.
- Got it.

716
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,110
Go, go.

717
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,870
Okay. To the right.

718
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,430
It's open. Just get in.

719
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,599
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

720
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,915
Should you really be driving?

721
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,790
Wait!

722
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,390
Shit!

723
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,233
You asshole! You left us.

724
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,353
- Are you okay?
- The hell I did.

725
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,750
- I saved your asses.
- Let's go!

726
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,240
- Here they come!
- Hold it right there!

727
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,470
We got to get out of here!

728
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,430
Hold on!

729
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,030
We're going too fast!

730
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,270
Oh, my God.

731
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,670
- Shit!
- Car!

732
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,830
God!

733
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,075
Watch out!

734
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,470
Oh, my God!

735
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,270
It's not funny.

736
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,910
Here we go.

737
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,669
Where are we going?

738
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,470
Hell yeah.

739
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,190
<i>Courtney!</i>

740
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,790
Come.

741
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,550
Look, I don't know if it's the experience
of dying and coming back again,

742
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,109
but I have got a really
intense craving right now.

743
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,113
For what, gelato?

744
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,270
No.

745
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,477
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

746
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,030
Sophia.

747
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,320
Sophia, open this door!

748
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,678
I think there's someone at the door.

749
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,679
- Sophia!
- I don't care.

750
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,470
Don't stop.

751
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,438
Sophia, I need you to open this door.

752
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,549
Sophia!

753
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,437
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Manning.

754
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,591
How dare you bring someone
back to my apartment.

755
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,909
I'm moving out.

756
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,913
- What did you say?
- I'm finding my own place.

757
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,590
You will do no such thing.

758
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,552
See, it doesn't matter what you say, Mom.

759
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,238
Whatever threats you make. I'm 25 years old.

760
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,152
Succeed or fail...

761
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,320
I'm doing it on my own.

762
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,120
Good night.

763
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,075
All right.

764
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,034
Good night.

765
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,469
How are you getting home?

766
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,519
There's a metro stop nearby.

767
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,397
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

768
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,594
It's important.

769
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,640
So, you gonna tell me or what?

770
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,796
I killed someone.

771
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,156
What?

772
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,913
It was two months ago.

773
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,957
It was my ER rotation.

774
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,558
The patient's name was Cyrus Gudgeon.

775
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,597
He was admitted for a jellyfish sting.

776
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,393
Cyrus Gudgeon. Yeah, I remember.
He got stung in the face.

777
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,270
Died of shock, right?

778
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,512
No, he died because of a mistake that I made.

779
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,117
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

780
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,352
But those two drugs don't cross-react.

781
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,193
He had metoprolol in his system.

782
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,359
He basically suffocated to death.

783
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,078
I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

784
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,880
and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

785
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,997
if he was taking any medications.

786
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,597
He would be alive right now
if it wasn't for my mistake.

787
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,275
Why are you telling me this?

788
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,834
Because I saw him.

789
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,879
Cyrus. I saw him in my flatline.

790
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,873
And it must mean something, right?

791
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,550
Hey, mistakes happen to everybody.

792
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,514
Yeah, but I work so hard every single day.

793
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,872
- I do the right thing.
- I'm sure you do.

794
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,792
- I'm not a bad person.
- No, you're not.

795
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,280
I'm not a bad person. I...

796
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,636
- Everything's gonna be fine, Marlo.
- No, I'm scared.

797
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,359
I'm scared.

798
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,440
Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,757
You... You can't just...

800
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,395
I'm... I'm sorry.

801
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,596
Yeah, what am I doing with you?

802
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,115
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry. No...
- No. No, no, no, wait.

803
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,233
- Damn, you have so many.
- Just...

804
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,549
Okay, okay.

805
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,960
I got it, I got it.

806
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,156
Courtney!

807
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,676
Help!

808
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,279
Help! Tessa!

809
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,950
Tessa!

810
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,590
Help!

811
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,436
My sister!

812
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,074
Help!

813
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,240
My sister!

814
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,160
- My sister.
- Come on.

815
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,640
No! My sister!

816
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,838
Tessa! My... Tessa!

817
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,354
No!

818
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,274
I hope this doesn't become awkward.

819
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,755
Too late.

820
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,594
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

821
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,390
Why?

822
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,191
Well, first I tell you that I'm responsible

823
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,999
for the death of a patient,

824
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,073
and then I go and totally attack you.

825
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,994
I mean, seriously, what...

826
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,953
What do you see in me?

827
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,233
You're really hot.

828
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,274
Shut up.

829
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,594
I got to go.

830
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,716
Yeah.

831
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,360
It was four months into our first year.

833
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,511
You were assisting at the oncology ward.

834
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,799
A breast cancer patient was there
for her first round of chemo.

835
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,079
She was anxious and scared,
but you sat down and calmed her

836
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,153
by asking about her kids, her job.

837
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,072
You were so kind.

838
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,720
You didn't think anyone was watching,

839
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,555
but I was watching you through the door.

840
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,314
Three hours later, I stopped by,

841
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,876
and you were there checking on her again.

842
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,640
That's what I see in you.

843
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,473
<i>Jamie?</i>

844
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,553
Courtney? What's going on?

845
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,233
I saw my sister.

846
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,760
What?

847
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,513
At the waterfront.

848
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,794
It was her.

849
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,397
I saw my dead sister.

850
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,199
Where... Where are you?

851
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,317
I'm home.

852
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,073
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

853
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,514
Stay there.

854
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm coming over.

855
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,916
<i>I just... I miss my sister.</i>

856
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,554
I should have told you all that

857
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,270
this wasn't about

858
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,080
science or discovery.

859
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,680
I think I'm going crazy.

860
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,193
Like I'm seeing things.

861
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,433
Something I did.

862
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,474
It was my fault.

863
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,833
I'm sorry.

864
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,275
Tessa?

865
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,479
Tessa, is that really you?

866
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,234
Tessa, are you okay?

867
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,030
- What are you?
- <i>Courtney!</i>

868
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,271
<i>Courtney!</i>

869
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,359
Let's go!

870
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,676
Hi. An update on room four.

871
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,992
We've given the Lasix bolus,
and the output is limited.

872
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,159
It's been less than 50 cc's
in the last two hours.

873
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,275
All right.

874
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,032
They found her at
the bottom of a fire escape.

875
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,759
We'll know more after the autopsy,

876
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,797
but right now, it's unclear whether she fell,

877
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,554
jumped, or God knows what.

878
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,270
I know you all liked her.

879
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,034
And I'm sorry, but for now, I need you

880
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,675
to pick up her patient load
and divide it amongst yourselves.

881
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,319
We still have a hospital to run.

882
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,358
Do any of you know what might
have been going on with her?

883
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,036
Is there something you're not telling me?

884
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,600
All right.

885
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,320
It just doesn't feel real.

886
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,720
I know.

887
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,117
You know, I can't believe she's gone.

888
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,712
We need to talk.

889
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,352
Okay, something is happening to us,
and my mind is playing tricks on me.

890
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,159
This morning,
when I was swimming in the pool...

891
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,277
I can't talk, okay?

892
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,431
- I have rounds right now.
- Guys,

893
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,354
Wolfson already knows
we're holding something back.

894
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,796
The school is going to investigate her death.

895
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,872
I don't believe it was a suicide.

896
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,997
Maybe she fell.

897
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,878
You were there.

898
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,679
What happened?

899
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,234
She never answered the door.

900
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,511
I figured... She went to bed.

901
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,670
Hey, killer party?

902
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,637
You all look like shit.

903
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,120
Hey, listen,

904
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,998
if the school finds out
we have been flatlining,

905
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,555
we will be expelled.

906
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,155
And you can say goodbye to your future.

907
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,994
Any notes you've taken, destroy them.

908
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,120
I'm gonna get into Courtney's apartment,
get her phone, computer,

909
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,112
anything incriminating.

910
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,157
You know, you were right
this whole time, Ray.

911
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,516
We should've listened to you.

912
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,438
Yeah, that's true.

913
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,914
This isn't on you, man.

914
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,152
You should just walk away.

915
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,391
We'll keep your name out of it.

916
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,110
No.

917
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,200
I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,916
Whatever happens to all of you happens to me.

919
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,355
- Yes?
- <i>Hey.</i>

920
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,591
Look, bad news.

921
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,353
<i>Ray and I checked her apartment.</i>

922
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,750
We found her computer and some notes,

923
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,513
- but not her phone.
- <i>Campus security</i>

924
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,114
- could have gotten there before you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

925
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,238
<i>Assuming you're right
and it's not a criminal investigation,</i>

926
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,913
then all that stuff stays with her body.

927
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,071
Meaning you can go down there
and look for it.

928
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,992
Go down where?

929
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,754
Where do you think? The goddamn morgue.

930
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,840
Okay.

931
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,750
<i>Marlo.</i>

932
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,429
<i>Marlo.</i>

933
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,800
<i>Marlo?</i>

934
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,511
<i>Jamie...</i>

935
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,520
<i>Jamie.</i>

936
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,636
<i>Like I'm seeing things.</i>

937
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,433
<i>Something I did.</i>

938
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,551
<i>It was my fault.</i>

939
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,159
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

940
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,432
<i>Tessa?</i>

941
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,512
<i>Tessa, is that really you?</i>

942
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,992
<i>Are you okay?</i>

943
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,399
<i>What are you?</i>

944
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,752
Jesus Christ.

945
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,313
What was that?

946
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,915
She was talking to someone.

947
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,918
Someone was there.

948
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,633
You don't know that.

949
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,552
She could've been hallucinating.

950
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,279
It didn't sound like that to me.

951
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,478
What if it was Tessa?

952
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,520
What do you mean?

953
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,876
She saw something. You heard her.

954
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,519
She said that she did something.

955
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,279
Something was her fault.

956
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,238
What if that's it? What if...

957
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,830
What if our sins are coming for us?

958
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,320
Sins. That's ridiculous.

959
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,352
So, what are we gonna do?

960
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,954
What are we gonna do?

961
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,872
We're gonna tell each other
the goddamn truth.

962
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,838
That's what we're gonna do.

963
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,032
There's a girl I... I used to know.

964
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,475
Alicia.

965
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,678
She was a waitress at my dad's country club.

966
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,796
Oh, my God.

967
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,190
- You killed her?
- What? No.

968
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,397
No, I did not kill anyone.

969
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,030
I...

970
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,270
I... I...

971
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,714
I got her pregnant.

972
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,355
I wanted to help, you know?

973
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,753
Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

974
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,436
Anyway, the... The day came,

975
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,591
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

976
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,198
I... I drove right past.

977
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,512
I left her to fend for herself.

978
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,517
And she showed up in your flatline?

979
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,512
I wish that was all.

980
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,717
She showed up last night, too.

981
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,871
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

982
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,356
- What are you talking about?
- This.

983
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,033
I am talking about this.

984
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,759
Alicia did this to me.

985
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,837
Only it wasn't her.

986
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,758
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

987
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,160
Then what was it?

988
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,360
Jamie, what?

989
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,432
I... I don't know.

990
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,349
Something feeding off our guilty conscience.

991
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,392
What do you mean? Like...

992
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,995
Something demonic?

993
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:54,551
Maybe it's using our pasts, our sins.

994
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,639
Wait, wait.

995
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,995
We're rational people here.

996
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,833
You could have stabbed yourself.

997
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,832
People on drugs hurt themselves all the time.

998
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,798
There has to be a logical explanation.

999
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,109
I was 17.

1000
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,750
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

1001
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,513
so I hacked her text messages

1002
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,230
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

1003
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,073
It destroyed her.

1004
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,913
What is the point in confessing all of this?

1005
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,071
This is clearly just happening here.

1006
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,551
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

1007
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,996
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

1008
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,276
Wait, so you knew?

1009
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,080
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

1010
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,799
and... And you still let me and Marlo go in?

1011
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,678
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

1012
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,197
Side effects may include dry mouth,
hallucinations, existential dread.

1013
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,351
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

1014
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,999
and start hunting us down.

1015
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,033
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

1016
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,351
We're way beyond explanations.

1017
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,840
Okay.

1018
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,191
If Courtney was right,

1019
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,556
whatever's happening to us,

1020
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,792
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

1021
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,076
it's only gonna get worse.

1022
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,913
Until we figure it out,

1023
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,630
until we figure out what to do,

1024
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:10,114
whatever killed her
is gonna kill all of us, too.

1025
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,034
Note the negative mass effect
secondary to the encephalomalacia.

1026
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,471
There are multiple foci of high
T2 and FLAIR signal intensity

1027
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,233
in the supratentorial white matter.

1028
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,880
These findings are nonspecific,
but most in keeping with

1029
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,798
chronic microangiopathic changes.

1030
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,718
You'll note there's no hydrocephalus.

1031
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,957
There's no brain herniation.
The vessels are well seen.

1032
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,797
You'll note that the gray matter

1033
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,270
differentiation is completely maintained.

1034
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,671
You little slut.
I can't believe you slept with him.

1035
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,399
Not only are you a hopeless grind,

1036
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,911
but you're an immature,
whiney, crybaby bitch.

1037
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,640
- Okay, stop!
- Excuse me?

1038
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,436
Sorry. Sorry.

1039
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,876
No.

1040
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,474
No! No! No!

1041
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,914
No!

1042
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,236
No.

1043
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,080
No.

1044
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,590
No.

1045
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,510
No.

1046
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,837
Stop!

1047
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,877
Stop! No!

1048
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,950
No!

1049
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,878
Stop! No!

1050
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,270
Hey.

1051
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,750
Hey.

1052
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,716
What are you doing here?

1053
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,269
Have you seen Cyrus Gudgeon lately?

1054
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,352
If that's supposed to be a joke,

1055
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,079
- it's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

1056
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,754
Then what?

1057
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,275
I pulled the autopsy report.

1058
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,317
It says nothing about metoprolol.

1059
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,759
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

1060
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,832
and there it was.

1061
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,560
Metoprolol.

1062
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,074
I'm going inside.

1063
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,911
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

1064
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,550
Marlo?

1065
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,871
Marlo.

1066
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,078
Did you change that autopsy report?

1067
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,511
I had to protect myself.

1068
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,192
Protect yourself? Really?

1069
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,272
By making it look like he died from a sting

1070
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,919
and not a drug you administered?

1071
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,400
I know.

1072
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:47,394
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

1073
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,279
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

1074
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,397
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

1075
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,470
Why?

1076
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,631
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

1077
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,120
You don't see it?

1078
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,793
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

1079
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,397
You know, it was so nice being with you

1080
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,633
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

1081
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,632
And now you have to go and spoil it.

1082
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,315
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

1083
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,551
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

1084
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,919
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

1085
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,032
I've worked my whole life for this.

1086
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,034
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

1087
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,679
is not gonna bring the guy back.

1088
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,195
All it's gonna do is end my career.

1089
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,915
That is the point here,

1090
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,753
your career.

1091
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:44,111
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

1092
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,474
Say it.

1093
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,880
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

1094
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,352
Hi. Is this Beverly Wong?

1095
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,310
Beverly Wong from East Hadley?

1096
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,990
It is?

1097
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,351
Do you have a daughter named Irina?

1098
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,075
Hey.

1099
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,799
Thanks for coming with me.

1100
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,600
Could you have rented a smaller car?

1101
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,515
You're sure it's the same Irina?

1102
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,349
Irina.

1103
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,635
Yes.

1104
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,120
It's Sophia.

1105
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,238
From East Hadley.

1106
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,516
We went to the same high school.

1107
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,911
I'm sorry. I know, it... It's...
It's been forever.

1108
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,070
I...

1109
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,470
I really needed to talk to you,
so I was hoping we could sit down...

1110
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,199
What is this about?

1111
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,830
You never knew this, but...

1112
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,198
I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.

1113
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,480
That was me.

1114
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,918
I can't stand myself to think about it.

1115
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,238
Bottom line, it was
an awful thing to do. I know that.

1116
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,118
What do you want?

1117
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,400
I'd like you to accept my apology.

1118
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,194
It's not necessary.

1119
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,954
Okay? I've moved on.

1120
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,077
Irina... This is important, okay?

1121
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,958
I am so sorry.

1122
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,758
Irina, please.

1123
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,120
Sophia.

1124
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,075
I forgive you.

1125
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,074
Thank you.

1126
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,914
What'd she say?

1127
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,834
<i>Hey, Marlo, it's Jamie.</i>

1128
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,640
- Hey.
- <i>Look, we're just kind of riffing here,</i>

1129
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,359
but maybe you find whoever you've wronged,

1130
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,718
whatever you're feeling guilty about,
and you take responsibility.

1131
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,393
<i>I mean, look, who knows if it'll work?</i>

1132
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,359
<i>But what have we got to lose?</i>

1133
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,236
Alicia!

1134
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,196
Alicia.

1135
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,114
Hey. It's... It's me.

1136
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,192
It's Jamie.

1137
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,434
What are you doing here, Jamie?

1138
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,114
He's your son?

1139
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:35,075
Hey. Hey... I came to apologize.

1140
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,117
For taking off on you.

1141
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,318
I... I panicked. I was a coward.

1142
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,710
I should have been there for you.

1143
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,996
But you weren't.

1144
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,515
Look, I...

1145
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,075
I want to make amends.

1146
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,753
Do what's right.

1147
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,672
Help... Help you out.

1148
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,592
Whatever you need.

1149
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,400
Alicia.

1150
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,520
Who is that man, Mommy?

1151
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,549
What?

1152
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,110
What the hell?

1153
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,430
Sophia?

1154
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,954
<i>I just got a message from Marlo.</i>

1155
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,191
<i>Something's wrong. And her phone is off.</i>

1156
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,680
We need to find her.

1157
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,274
Okay. Where are you?

1158
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,079
I'm... I'm gonna come to you.

1159
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,230
Marlo?

1160
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,760
Marlo!

1161
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,957
<i>She's not here, man.</i>

1162
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,315
Wait. Wait!

1163
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,436
Marlo?

1164
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,518
Forget it. She's here.

1165
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,114
<i>Come as fast as you can!</i>

1166
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,434
I'm nearly there.

1167
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,874
You got to hurry.

1168
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,155
Ray!

1169
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,000
She must be down there. Come.

1170
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,753
Okay.

1171
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,596
Come on!

1172
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,995
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1173
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,673
Oh, my God. How long has she been under?

1174
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,315
It's been over four minutes.

1175
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,720
- BVM?
- Sure.

1176
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,635
Come on. We need oxygen!

1177
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,115
Cyrus. I'm so sorry.

1178
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,674
Forgive me.

1179
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,917
Will you please forgive me?

1180
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,870
No pulse.

1181
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,197
Take over the compressions.

1182
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,272
Go, go, go!

1183
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,399
It's not working. Shit.

1184
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,480
Stop.

1185
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,639
Nothing.

1186
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,833
Ray.

1187
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,316
Marlo, don't you get it?

1188
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,072
I need you to come back.

1189
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,635
To me.

1190
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,834
<i>Marlo, Marlo...</i>

1191
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,634
<i>Marlo? Marlo.</i>

1192
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,955
No! No!

1193
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,274
<i>Marlo.</i>

1194
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,156
You have to forgive yourself.

1195
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,674
Forgive yourself, Marlo.

1196
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,796
No!

1197
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,755
Charge 360.

1198
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,600
Okay. Okay.

1199
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,114
Oh, my...

1200
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,796
It's okay. It's okay.

1201
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,029
Hey.

1202
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,556
Here.

1203
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,960
There you go.

1204
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,680
Thank you.

1205
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,160
You okay?

1206
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,235
Yeah.

1207
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,312
I found the girl.

1208
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,318
And a little boy.

1209
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,275
Yeah.

1210
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,754
The hell with going to L.A.

1211
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,116
I'm getting a residency right here.

1212
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,715
Be near them.

1213
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,953
I'm gonna try.

1214
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,517
<i>Courtney was right.</i>

1215
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,717
<i>It's not enough to apologize.</i>

1216
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,315
<i>We have to face up to what we've done,</i>

1217
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,074
<i>and then forgive ourselves.</i>

1218
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:24,794
<i>Some lines should not be crossed.</i>

1219
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,270
<i>We lost a friend.</i>

1220
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,996
<i>We will never be the same.</i>

1221
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,115
Where were you?

1222
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,839
I talked to the dean.

1223
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,559
How'd it go?

1224
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,313
I'm on probation.

1225
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,831
Did you bring it?

1226
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,274
Here.

1227
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,840
Only Courtney knows now.

1228
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:18,311
Feels so weird just being here
without Courtney.

1229
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,872
Anyone want to say something?

1230
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,598
Let's just get hammered.

1231
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,070
Why don't you say something?

1232
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,393
To Courtney.

1233
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,633
To Courtney.
