"Baseball was proof positive that democracy was real. A baseball box score after all, is a democratic thing.

"I love this game. I love baseball. Given my whole life to it. 40 odd years ago I was a player coach at Ohio-Wesleyan University. We had a Negro catcher. Best hitter on the team. Charlie Thomas. Fine young man. I saw him laid low, broken because of the color of his skin and I didn't do enough to help. Told myself I did but I didn't. There was something unfair at the heart of the game I loved and I ignored it. But a time came when I could no longer do that. You...you let me love baseball again",Branch Rickey
