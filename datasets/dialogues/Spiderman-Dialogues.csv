(first words of the movie) Who am I? You sure you wanna know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
(after Norman suggests they be like father and son) I have a father. His name was Ben Parker.
(letting robber get away) I missed the part where that's my problem.
(confronting the carjacker who killed his Uncle Ben) What about my uncle? Did you give him a chance? Did you? ANSWER ME!
"(Spider-Man saves Mary-Jane at the World Unity Festival) Well, beats taking the subway. Don't mind us. She needs to use the elevator."
"It's you who's out, Gobby! Out of your mind!"
(while fighting Bonesaw McGraw) Staying away from you. That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?
"(last words of the movie) Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."
Sorry I'm late. Work was murder.
"I know this has been a difficult time for you, but I want you to try to enjoy this day. Commencement: the end of one thing, the start of something new."
Back to formula?!?
"OUT, AM I?!"
[last words] Peter? Don't tell Harry.
[after blocking Spider-Man's Punch] Impressive!
[Spraying Spider-Man with Knockout Gas] Sleeeeeep!
"Misery, misery, misery, that's what you chosen. I offered you friendship, and you spat in my face."
"We'll meet again, Spider-Man!"
No one says no to me!
Follow the cold shiver running down your spine.
Can Spider-Man come out to play?
[singing] The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout. Down came the Goblin and took the spider out!
Spider-Man! This is why only fools are heroes - because you never know when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice!
"[to his son Harry, about Mary Jane] Harry, please. Look at her. You think a woman like that's sniffing around because she likes your personality? Your mother was beautiful too, they're all beautiful - until they're snarling after your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves!"
We are who we choose to be... NOW CHOOSE!
"A word to the not-so-wise about your little girlfriend: do what you need to with her, then broom her fast!"
"You've spun your last web, Spider-Man. Had you not been so selfish, your little girlfriend's death would have been quick and painless, but now that you've really pissed me off, I'm gonna finish her nice and slow. M.J. and I, we're gonna have a hell of a time!"
Forty thousand years of evolution and we've barely even tapped the vastness of human potential.
I am going to rectify certain inequities.
"Godspeed, Spider-Man."
"The one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying. In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you."
"Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz. You know, I'm something of a scientist myself."
"If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo! Put it up on the front page: ""Cash Money For a Picture of Spider-Man!"" He doesn't wanna be famous? Then I'll make him infamous!"
"No jobs! Freelance! Best thing in the world for somebody your age. You bring me some more pictures of that newspaper-selling clown, maybe I'll take 'em off your hands. But I never said you have a job! Meat. I'll send you a nice box of Christmas meat, it's the best I can do. Get out of here. Bring me more photos."
"They're crap. Crap, crap, mega crap. I'll give you $200 for all of 'em."
"""Who is Spider-Man?"" He's a criminal, that's who he is! A vigilante! A public menace! What's he doing on MY front page?"
He's saved my life twice and I've never even seen his face.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
"I better run, tiger."
