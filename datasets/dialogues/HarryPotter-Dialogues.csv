"[to DA in Hog's Head] Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow, but out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes, you don't know what that's like."
"[Addressing Dumbledore's Army] Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself. Think of it this way; every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now, students. If they can do it, why not us?"

Uncle Vernon: [In response to a howler convicting Harry of Underage Wizardry] JUSTICE.

"Sybill Trelawney: (goes into a trance, makes a prediction) The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not... For neither can live while the other s-survives."
Ronald Weasley: [repeated line] Bloody hell...
"Seamus Finnigan: Harry! [Harry turns around] Well, I...er...I...um...Well, what I'm really trying to say is, I believe you. [Harry, Ron and Hermione stare at him in disbelief]"
"Molly Weasley: OH! Just because you're allowed to use magic now does NOT mean you have to whip your wands out for EVERYTHING!!!!! Are you hungry, Harry?"
"Sirius Black: [Last words; After Harry attacks Lucius Malfoy] Nice one, James!"
