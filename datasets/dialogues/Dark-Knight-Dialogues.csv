"Do you wanna know how I got these scars?  My father was a drinker, and a fiend.  And one night, he goes off crazier than usual.  Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.  He doesn't like that.  Not. One. Bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.  He turns to me, and he says, ""Why so serious?""  He comes at me with the knife. ""Why so serious?!""  He sticks the blade in my mouth—""Let's put a smile on that face!""  And... Why so serious ?",Joker
"Don't talk like you're one of them! You're not - even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me. They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out - like a leper. See, their ""morals"", their ""code""... it's a bad joke, dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these, ah, ""civilized people""? They'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.",Joker
"You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan""... even if the plan is horrifying. If, tomorrow, I say that, like, a gang-banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because ""it's all part of the plan"". But I say that one little old mayor will die... and everybody loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.",Joker

"Let me get this straight: You think that your client - one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world - is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person? [chuckles] Good luck.",Lucius Fox
Accomplice? I'm gonna tel them the whole thing was your idea!,Bruce Wayne
"Choose between one life or the other: Your friend the District Attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be! [laughs as Batman punches him again] You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with! Nothing to do with all your strength! But don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are! Both of them, and that's the point. You'll have to choose. He's at 250 52nd Street and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.",Joker
"""Freak""… Why don't we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to your pooches? Hm? And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is! It's not about money. It's about…sending a message. Everything burns!",Joker
"I took Gotham's ""White Knight"", and I brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know, is like gravity: all it takes is a little push! [laughs hysterically as he is taken into custody]",Joker
"Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.",James Gordon
"You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me, set the dogs on me. Because that's what needs to happen. Because sometimes…the truth isn't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. [runs]",Batman
