I have so many questions. Where do I come from?
"My father believed that if the world found out who I really was, they'd reject me…out of fear. I let my father die because I trusted him. Because he was convinced that I had to wait, that the world was not ready. What do you think?"
Krypton had its chance!
"Let's put our cards on the table, General. You're scared of me because you can't control me. You don't, and you never will. But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy."
YOU THINK YOU CAN THREATEN MY MOTHER!?
What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended? What if a child aspired to something greater?
"Earth's sun is younger and brighter than ours was. Your cells have drunk in its radiation, strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses. Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing. You've grown stronger here than I ever could've imagined. The only way to know how strong is to keep testing your limits. You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders."
You can save her Kal. You can save all of them.
"Silencing me won't change anything. My son is twice the man you were, and he will finish what we started, I can promise you that."
"Make a better world than ours, Kal."
"His name is Kal, son of El, and he's beyond your reach."
People are afraid of what they don't understand.
"You're not just anyone, Clark, and I have to believe that you're—that you're sent here for a reason. All these changes you're going through, one day—one day, you're goin'a think of them as a blessing, and when that day comes, you're goin'a have to make a choice: a choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not."
"You'll just have to decide what kind of man you'll want to grow up to be, Clark, because whoever that man is, good character or bad, he's—he's gonna change the world."
"How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks? For some, he was a guardian angel. To others, a ghost who never quite fit in."
Welcome to the Planet.
"What's the ""S"" stands for? .....well ,here it's an S. ...well ,how about ""Super...""."
"My name is General Zod. I come from a world far from yours. I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you. For some time, your world has sheltered one of my citizens. I request that you return this individual to my custody. For reasons unknown, he has chosen to keep his existence a secret from you. He will have made efforts to blend in. He will look like you, but he is not one of you. To those of you who may know of his current location: the fate of your planet rests in your hands. To Kal-El, I say this: surrender within twenty-four hours, or watch this world suffer the consequences..."
"Tell me, you have Jor-El's memories, his conscience, can you experience his pain? I will harvest the Codex from your son's corpse, and I will rebuild Krypton atop his bones."
"If you destroy this ship, YOU DESTROY KRYPTON!"
"Look at this. We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor, but you choose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the sole purpose for which I was born, and every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people.  My soul—that is what you have taken from me!"
"There is only one way this ends, Kal: either you die or I do."
"I was bred to be a warrior, Kal-El, trained my entire life to master my senses. Where did you train? ON A FARM!?"
