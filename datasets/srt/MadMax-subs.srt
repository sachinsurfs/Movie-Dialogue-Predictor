1
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,639
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,075
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

4
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,179
- <i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>
- <i>Oil wars.</i>

5
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,215
- <i>We are killing for guzzoline.</i>
- <i>Guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,117
<i>The world is actually
running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:37,453
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:40,089
<i>Once, I was a cop,</i>

9
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:43,025
<i>a road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,761
<i>...to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,599
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,435
- <i>The earth is sour.</i>
- <i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

14
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:55,605
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

15
00:00:55,705 --> 00:01:01,110
<i>As the world fell, each of us,
in our own way, was broken.</i>

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,205
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy...</i>

17
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,143
<i>me or everyone else.</i>

18
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,848
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,118
<i>Where are you?</i>

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,068
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

21
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:28,438
- <i>Here they come again.</i>
- <i>Max Rockatansky.</i>

22
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,908
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

23
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,835
- <i>Help us, Max.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

24
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,550
<i>I tell myself... they cannot touch me.</i>

25
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,720
<i>They are long dead.</i>

26
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,180
After him!

27
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,984
After him!

28
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,990
Now!

29
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:49,385
<i>I am the one who runs
from both the living and the dead,</i>

30
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,554
<i>hunted by scavengers,</i>

31
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:55,449
<i>haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

32
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,363
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

33
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:17,046
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct...</i>

34
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:19,339
<i>survive.</i>

35
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:42,823
Max? Is that you? Where were you?

36
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:48,604
Help us. Where were you?
Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?

37
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,700
Stop running, Max. Stop running.

38
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,783
You let us die.

39
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,228
You let us die!

40
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,030
You let us die!

41
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,931
You promised to help us.

42
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:38,142
Witness!

43
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,909
- We are War Boys!
- War Boys!

44
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,179
- Kamakrazee War Boys!
- War Boys!

45
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,982
Fucacima Kamakrazee War Boys!

46
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,084
Hooked on!

47
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:46,889
- Today we're headin' to Gas Town!
- Gas Town!

48
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:51,252
- Today we're haulin' Aqua Cola.
- Aqua cola!

49
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:54,797
- Today we're haulin' produce!
- Produce!

50
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,467
And today we're haulin' mother's milk!

51
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,036
Mother's milk!

52
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,221
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

53
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,765
Once again, we send off my war rig

54
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:06,168
to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town

55
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,205
and bullets from The Bullet Farm.

56
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:15,277
Once again,
I salute my imperator, Furiosa!

57
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:19,448
And I salute my half-life War Boys

58
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:22,084
who will ride with me eternal

59
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:26,105
on the highways of Valhalla.

60
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,959
I am your redeemer!

61
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,728
It is by my hand

62
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:38,000
you will rise from the ashes
of this world!

63
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,843
It's comin'. Get ready.

64
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:52,381
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's comin'.

65
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:53,108
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.

66
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:58,980
It will take hold of you.
And you will resent its absence.

67
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,341
Get 'em all off!

68
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,910
Get 'em all off!

69
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,670
Clear off!

70
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,182
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

71
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:11,687
I got a War Boy runnin' on empty.

72
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,347
Hook up that full-life.

73
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,429
Careful. That's a universal donor.

74
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:19,979
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

75
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,200
Bullet Farm?

76
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,098
We're heading east.

77
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,567
I'll pass it down the line.

78
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,137
New orders! Thunder up! Thunder up!

79
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:37,439
This is not a supply run!

80
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,528
- Go. Go. Go.
- Ace, what's going on?

81
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:41,977
- We're heading east.
- Why?

82
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,638
I don't know. That's the order.

83
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,065
Moo.

84
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,659
Hey, pa. You know about this?

85
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,963
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

86
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:23,519
She's gone off-road...
into hostile territory.

87
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,800
Why would she do that, Dad?

88
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,226
- Let me see. Let me see. I wanna see!
- Rictus.

89
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:35,422
Rictus, go see what's agitating Dad!

90
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:05,160
Splendid!

91
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,987
Angharad!

92
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:17,706
Where are they?

93
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,775
They are not your property.

94
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,511
- Miss Giddy?
- You cannot own a human being.

95
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:25,981
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

96
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,454
Where is she taking them?!

97
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:31,345
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go.

98
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:36,458
- Where is she taking them?
- A long way from you.

99
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,744
Hey, what's happening?

100
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:09,525
Slit. What's going on? Slit!

101
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,494
Treason, betrayal,
an imperator gone rogue.

102
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,096
An imperator. Who?

103
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:17,299
Furiosa. She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

104
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,636
- What stuff?
- Breeders. His prize breeders.

105
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,363
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.

106
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,540
By my deeds, I honor him. V-8.

107
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,596
- That's my wheel.
- I'm driving.

108
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,399
- You're my lancer.
- I just promoted myself.

109
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,135
- Not today. Today is my day.
- Look at you!

110
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,204
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!

111
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,873
- He's right, son.
- I'm not staying here dying soft.

112
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:01,151
You're already a corpse.

113
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,912
- I just need a top-up, some more juice.
- There's no time!

114
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,516
We take my blood bag. We take my blood bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

115
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,691
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral.

116
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,546
That's right. High-octane
crazy blood fillin' me up.

117
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,762
If I'm gonna die...

118
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,997
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.

119
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,674
- Yeah. Yeah. Organic.
- Yeah?

120
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,292
- Hitch up his blood bag.
- Right-o.

121
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,119
Yeah!

122
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,950
How much more can they take from me?
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

123
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,535
Immortan!

124
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:32,430
Immortan Joe!

125
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,771
He looked at me!

126
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:39,341
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your blood bag!

127
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,844
He turned his head.
He looked me straight in the eye.

128
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:44,246
He was scanning the horizon.

129
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,649
No. I am awaited.

130
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,843
I am awaited in Valhalla!

131
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,347
<i>Confucamus!</i>

132
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:59,261
Immortan!

133
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,354
Yeah!

134
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,043
- Hey! Heads up!
- Heads up!

135
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,010
Boss!

136
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,961
We got vehicles from The Citadel.
They're firing flares.

137
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:36,264
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm.

138
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,634
What is this? Backup? Decoy?

139
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:41,561
It's a detour.

140
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:16,010
Eyes right.

141
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:21,576
Buzzards! Buzzards right!
Eyes on! Eyes on!

142
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:23,612
Buzzards right! Eyes on!

143
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,113
Yeah!

144
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:30,118
Should we turn it 'round
and run 'em into our backup?

145
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:33,617
No. We're good.

146
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,636
We fang it!

147
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,245
Thunder up! Here we go!

148
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,258
Prepare the gunners!

149
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,637
Morsov!

150
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,294
Come on, attack!

151
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,934
War!

152
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,650
Ready!

153
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,272
She's ours, Slit! She's ours.

154
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,174
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

155
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:41,111
Form up!

156
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,257
That's my head!

157
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,749
Get up! You can do it!

158
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,630
Morsov!

159
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:32,470
- Morsov!
- No!

160
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,605
- Witness me!
- Witness!

161
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:48,296
Witness!

162
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:54,274
Mediocre, Morsov! Mediocre!

163
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,968
Ready!

164
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,845
Get ready!

165
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,736
Back me in!

166
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,053
They're coming!

167
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:55,008
- We can't breathe down there!
- Stay out of sight!

168
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,243
Now!

169
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,532
Go back!

170
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,845
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!

171
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,693
Yeah.

172
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:45,766
Now we bring home the Booty.

173
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,528
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

174
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:18,391
She thinks we're stupid.
She thinks she can lose us in there!

175
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:39,888
Fang it! Fang it!

176
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:48,015
Why can't you stop?

177
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,966
Crew! Outta the way! Out of the way!

178
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,760
What have you done? What have you done?!

179
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,050
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.

180
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:32,364
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

181
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,668
Hey, head... say bye-bye to the neck!

182
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:02,328
- <i>Decapito!</i>
- We're goin' in, Slit!

183
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:07,160
Come on! We've almost got her!

184
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,336
Come on! Hold it steady!

185
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:48,134
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

186
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,957
I am the man... who grabs the sun...

187
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:17,117
riding to Valhalla!

188
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,766
Witness me, blood bag!

189
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:26,539
Witness!

190
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,831
I live, I die, I live again!

191
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:37,406
We're not going back.

192
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:07,394
Water.

193
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,267
You.

194
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,295
Angharad, is that just the wind,
or is it a furious vexation?

195
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,119
I got it!

196
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,339
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.

197
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:41,108
He's gonna shred her. Shred her!

198
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,977
Bolt cutters.

199
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,937
Chain.

200
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,005
Hey, hey!

201
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,219
Oh, look at them.

202
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:56,791
So shiny, so chrome.
He's gonna be so grateful.

203
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:00,261
We could ask for anything.

204
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,063
I wanna drive the war rig.

205
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,366
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

206
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,167
Sure.

207
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:09,770
I mean, you can ask
for more than a jacket.

208
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,205
We're going to the Green Place.

209
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:13,065
Wait, it's you and me.

210
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:29,756
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

211
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,609
How does it feel?

212
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:53,580
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

213
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,308
You wanna get through this?

214
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:02,406
Do as I say.

215
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,887
Now pick up what you can and run.

216
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:52,331
Kill switches.

217
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:57,636
I set the sequence myself.
This rig goes nowhere without me.

218
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,284
You can get in.

219
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,544
Not without them.

220
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,530
So we wait.

221
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,540
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

222
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,701
You've already damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

223
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,020
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

224
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,183
I'd say you've got
about a five-minute head start.

225
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:54,626
You want that thing off your face?

226
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,039
Let's go.

227
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,187
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

228
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:16,775
Smeg!

229
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:38,939
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

230
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,708
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

231
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:42,876
- Why?
- To bargain.

232
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,178
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.

233
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:45,867
Do you think he's coming
to the Green Place?

234
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,941
Never! He's a crazy smeg
who eats <i>schlanger!</i>

235
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,112
- Stay out of there.
- Behind you.

236
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,385
The Gas Town boys.

237
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:28,347
Don't damage the goods.

238
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:35,988
What do you see?

239
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,334
Big Rigs.

240
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,503
Polecats.

241
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,639
Flamers.

242
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,009
And there's the People Eater himself.

243
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:52,212
Coming to count the cost.

244
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:11,999
We're dragging something out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.

245
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,115
No, no.

246
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:17,412
I'll go.

247
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:42,947
Filth! You traited him!

248
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:47,730
No unnecessary killing!

249
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,542
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

250
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:52,332
He's Kamakrazee!

251
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:54,835
He's just a kid at the end
of his half-life.

252
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:57,704
No! I live, I die, I live again!

253
00:45:57,804 --> 00:45:59,512
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

254
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:01,123
Throw him out!

255
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:03,092
Chuck him out.

256
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:04,978
You got more friends.

257
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:10,560
Bullet Farmer.
They're coming from The Bullet Farm.

258
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,147
Yeah?

259
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:14,622
It's over. You can't defy him.

260
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:16,790
- Watch us, mate.
- He is the one who grabbed the sun.

261
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,725
Look at how slick
he's fooled you, War Boy!

262
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:21,795
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand, we'll be lifted up!

263
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:24,398
That's why we have his logo
seared on our backs!

264
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:26,200
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"

265
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,403
- No, I am awaited!
- You're an old man's battle fodder!

266
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:32,072
- Killing everyone and everything!
- We're not to blame!

267
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,241
Then who killed the world?

268
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:04,576
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

269
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:06,907
I don't know if it's still any good.

270
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:10,936
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.

271
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:19,490
I need you here.

272
00:47:20,653 --> 00:47:22,022
You may have to drive the rig.

273
00:47:27,922 --> 00:47:29,601
You.

274
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:31,611
You stay.

275
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:33,892
You stay there.

276
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:39,072
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

277
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:42,934
I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.

278
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,475
Down here.

279
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,538
Hey.

280
00:48:13,638 --> 00:48:15,783
What's your name?

281
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:19,047
What do I call you?

282
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,480
Does it matter?

283
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,203
Fine.

284
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:27,712
When I yell "fool," you drive
out of here as fast as you can.

285
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:32,548
This is the sequence... one.

286
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:35,162
One, two. One.

287
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,698
Red, black, go.

288
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,636
You have it?

289
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:06,920
It's all here!

290
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:10,915
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

291
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:16,596
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

292
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,382
You drop the rocks.

293
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:33,613
You said, "a few vehicles
in pursuit. Maybe."

294
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:36,483
We count three war parties!

295
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:40,578
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.
Let's do this!

296
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:08,315
Fool!

297
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,824
That's our fuel!

298
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:08,108
Make way for the ripsaw!

299
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:26,427
Once I'm over, clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

300
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:29,763
Immortan! Immortan Joe!

301
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:33,557
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the war rig!

302
00:52:35,617 --> 00:52:38,558
You! Climb aboard!

303
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:40,907
Hey! Hey!

304
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:45,913
I got his boot!
I got the blood bag's boot!

305
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:49,783
Take me! I got his boot!

306
00:52:51,356 --> 00:52:53,753
All this for a family squabble.

307
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:56,856
Healthy babies.

308
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,194
Reload the clip.

309
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:08,722
I can't.

310
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,863
Gun!

311
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,331
- Give the gun!
- It's not loaded yet!

312
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,925
- You! We had a deal!
- Now!

313
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:10,650
Rictus!

314
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,611
The wives! No more flames.

315
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:21,594
Splendid!

316
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:26,924
Splendid! That's my child! My property!

317
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,192
Immorta...

318
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:43,516
Immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

319
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,118
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

320
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:48,354
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.

321
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:49,656
No.

322
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:54,427
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig,
return my treasures to me,

323
00:56:54,727 --> 00:57:00,533
and I myself will carry you
to the gates of Valhalla.

324
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:02,869
Am I awaited?

325
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:07,607
You will ride eternal...
shiny and chrome.

326
00:57:08,507 --> 00:57:10,276
Rictus!

327
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,345
Help him aboard!

328
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,302
Ready?

329
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:17,579
Here we go!

330
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:30,655
Mediocre!

331
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:01,918
<i>Schlanger!</i>

332
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:22,740
Look out!

333
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:29,280
Angharad! Get out!

334
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:51,936
- No!
- Angharad!

335
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:09,053
Stop! Turn the rig around!

336
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:12,053
Go back for her!

337
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,634
- No.
- Tell him to turn the rig around!

338
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:19,305
- Did you see it?
- She went under the wheels.

339
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,741
Did you see it?

340
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:24,143
She went under the wheels.

341
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:27,400
- We keep moving.
- No!

342
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,956
- We keep moving!
- He doesn't know what he's talking about!

343
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:33,028
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

344
00:59:33,128 --> 00:59:35,521
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it.

345
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:51,371
- You all right?
- On! On!

346
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:29,809
Cheedo!

347
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:31,844
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

348
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:34,680
- Stop!
- He'll forgive us. I know he will.

349
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,717
- There is no going back!
- We were his treasures!

350
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:39,552
- Cheedo!
- We were protected.

351
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:40,854
He gave us the high life.

352
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:43,089
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

353
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:46,161
No!

354
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:49,362
- Cheedo, we are not things!
- We are not things.

355
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:52,231
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

356
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:54,667
And now she's dead!

357
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,193
Wring your hands.

358
01:00:58,337 --> 01:01:01,374
- You're not going back to him.
- Angharad!

359
01:01:01,474 --> 01:01:03,900
Come on! Come on!

360
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,863
So...

361
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:25,899
Where is this...

362
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,701
This Green Place?

363
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:31,304
It's a long night's run, heading east.

364
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:38,301
We need inventory. I want you
to match every gun with its bullets.

365
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,282
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

366
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:45,885
- We need someone down the back.
- I'll go.

367
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,422
No. I want you to stay together.

368
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:51,115
I can do it.

369
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:26,324
What are you doing here?

370
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:30,662
He saw it. He saw it all.

371
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:35,124
My own blood bag
drivin' the rig that killed her.

372
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:43,834
Stop doing that.

373
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:47,238
Stop.

374
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,226
Thr... three times
the gates were open to me.

375
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:02,237
What gates?

376
01:03:02,337 --> 01:03:06,597
I was awaited in Valhalla.
They were calling my name.

377
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:10,361
I should be walking with the immorta,
mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.

378
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,376
I'd say it was
your manifest destiny not to.

379
01:03:18,776 --> 01:03:21,514
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

380
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:25,884
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

381
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:29,222
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

382
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:31,057
Who are Larry and Barry?

383
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:35,394
My mates. Larry and Barry.

384
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:40,624
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.

385
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:09,327
Well, we've only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

386
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:15,868
But we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

387
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:19,272
Angharad used to call them antiseed.

388
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:23,671
Plant one and watch something die.

389
01:05:57,794 --> 01:06:00,906
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline,

390
01:06:01,006 --> 01:06:04,843
19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,

391
01:06:04,943 --> 01:06:07,913
7 pursuit vehicles. The deficit mounts.

392
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:12,485
And now, sir, you have us
stuck in a quagmire.

393
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:14,420
Hey, Joe!

394
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,489
Boss!

395
01:06:18,346 --> 01:06:21,017
Your girly's breathing her last!

396
01:06:21,117 --> 01:06:23,639
What about the child?

397
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:35,707
- Are ya comin', brother?
- Wait!

398
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:41,371
- It's gone awful quiet in there.
- Get it out. Get it out!

399
01:06:43,516 --> 01:06:45,684
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!

400
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,963
Patience!

401
01:06:49,442 --> 01:06:51,757
Oh, you stay here
with your grief, Daddy.

402
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:56,819
- I'll fetch 'em for ya.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

403
01:06:57,863 --> 01:07:00,533
Just one angry shot...

404
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:02,505
for Furiosa.

405
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:04,813
Hut!

406
01:07:11,106 --> 01:07:13,579
Cryin' shame.

407
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:15,799
Come.

408
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,808
Nother month...

409
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,919
Could've been your viable human.

410
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:23,080
- Was it a male?
- Your a-one Alpha prime.

411
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,529
Hey, Rictus!

412
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:31,493
You lost a baby brother.

413
01:07:33,198 --> 01:07:35,991
Perfect in every way.

414
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:41,807
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!

415
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:46,702
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!

416
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:17,654
Come on.

417
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,231
- Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.
- Just probing.

418
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,036
- He wants to help!
- Who?!

419
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,874
- The War Boy!
- Where did he come from?!

420
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:49,933
I thought we threw him off the rig!

421
01:08:53,512 --> 01:08:55,581
There's high ground
just beyond that thing.

422
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,418
- He means the tree.
- Yeah. Tree!

423
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:02,721
- Leave him to me.
- Say, anyone notice that bright light?

424
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:05,190
Encroaching gunfire?

425
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,226
- Get out.
- I can do this. I know this machine.

426
01:09:07,326 --> 01:09:09,000
He does. He's a revhead.

427
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:17,244
You've got two left.

428
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,099
On him.

429
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:42,919
Don't breathe.

430
01:09:46,598 --> 01:09:49,768
Hey! Hey! Hey! War Boy!

431
01:09:49,868 --> 01:09:52,571
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!

432
01:09:53,577 --> 01:09:56,709
Take this. Let's get the engine plates.

433
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:58,877
You drive the rig!

434
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:01,679
- Hold up a flare.
- I am holding a flare!

435
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:05,017
- Closer.
- It's right in front of your eyes!

436
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:19,321
Hut! Hut!

437
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:26,476
Blood bag!

438
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:34,813
I am the scales of justice!

439
01:10:34,913 --> 01:10:39,141
Conductor of the choir of death!

440
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,697
Sing, brother koch!

441
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:49,995
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

442
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,664
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

443
01:11:07,146 --> 01:11:09,475
Gun fever!

444
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:20,953
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

445
01:12:21,553 --> 01:12:23,688
How are the engines?

446
01:12:23,788 --> 01:12:26,348
Very hot and real thirsty.

447
01:12:29,994 --> 01:12:35,133
Hey. You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.

448
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:38,828
What if you're not back
by the time the engines have cooled?

449
01:12:40,338 --> 01:12:43,132
Well, you keep moving.

450
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,251
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

451
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:56,954
Retaliate first.

452
01:12:59,357 --> 01:13:01,450
Let's go!

453
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:22,840
Are you hurt?

454
01:14:23,275 --> 01:14:26,512
- You're bleeding.
- That's not his blood.

455
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:30,382
What is this?

456
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:33,225
It's mother's milk.

457
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:16,695
It's okay. Sleep.

458
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:20,189
Get some rest.

459
01:15:29,907 --> 01:15:33,069
How do you know this place even exists?

460
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:36,606
I was born there.

461
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:40,452
So why'd you leave?

462
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:43,154
I didn't.

463
01:15:43,254 --> 01:15:45,081
I was taken as a child.

464
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,399
Stolen.

465
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:57,676
- You done this before?
- Many times.

466
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:02,140
Now that I drive a war rig...

467
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,741
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

468
01:16:05,976 --> 01:16:07,079
And them?

469
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:11,649
They're looking for hope.

470
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:14,376
What about you?

471
01:16:18,523 --> 01:16:20,616
Redemption.

472
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:06,762
Hey, what's that?

473
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:21,578
I remember something like that.

474
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:35,192
Help me!

475
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:40,005
Help me!

476
01:17:42,506 --> 01:17:45,175
Help me, please!

477
01:17:46,043 --> 01:17:48,224
That's bait.

478
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,811
Stay in the rig.

479
01:17:55,186 --> 01:17:58,934
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

480
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:02,627
I am one of the Vuvalini!

481
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:05,397
Of the Many Mothers!

482
01:18:06,197 --> 01:18:09,801
My initiate mother was K.T. Concannon!

483
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:13,063
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

484
01:18:14,305 --> 01:18:18,194
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

485
01:19:04,454 --> 01:19:05,634
It's me.

486
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:15,933
There's something in the eyes.

487
01:19:16,033 --> 01:19:18,468
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

488
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:26,134
This is our Furiosa.

489
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:28,901
How long has it been?

490
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:35,487
7,000 days.
Plus the ones I don't remember.

491
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:38,390
Furiosa.

492
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:41,686
What happened to your mother?

493
01:19:41,786 --> 01:19:43,628
She died.

494
01:19:44,028 --> 01:19:46,355
On the third day.

495
01:19:52,637 --> 01:19:56,507
- From where did you come?
- The west. Citadel.

496
01:19:56,607 --> 01:19:58,901
Beyond the mountains.

497
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,582
The men... who are they?

498
01:20:04,682 --> 01:20:08,644
They're reliable.
They helped us get here.

499
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:23,028
Where did you find such creatures?

500
01:20:24,669 --> 01:20:26,638
So soft.

501
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,600
This one has all her teeth.

502
01:20:37,247 --> 01:20:39,884
I can't wait for them to see it.

503
01:20:39,984 --> 01:20:41,953
See?

504
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:45,781
- See what?
- Home.

505
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,729
The Green Place.

506
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:56,381
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.

507
01:20:56,781 --> 01:21:01,603
The crows. The creepy place
with all the crows.

508
01:21:02,203 --> 01:21:03,675
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

509
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,544
- We had no water and...
- The water was filth.

510
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:09,180
- It was poisoned. It was sour.
- And the crows came.

511
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,216
We couldn't grow anything.

512
01:21:11,316 --> 01:21:13,885
- Where are the others?
- What others?

513
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:17,447
- The Many Mothers.
- We're the only ones left.

514
01:22:17,915 --> 01:22:19,805
Look.

515
01:22:21,718 --> 01:22:24,688
That's what you call a satellite.

516
01:22:24,788 --> 01:22:26,958
Miss Giddy told us about those.

517
01:22:27,558 --> 01:22:30,996
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.

518
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:35,211
Shows. Everyone
in the old world had a show.

519
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,538
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

520
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:45,409
- Sending shows?
- Who knows.

521
01:22:45,509 --> 01:22:48,546
Those are the plains of silence.

522
01:22:50,446 --> 01:22:54,986
Stay right where you are, little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

523
01:22:55,086 --> 01:22:56,888
You having a baby?

524
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:00,495
Warlord Jr. Gonna be so ugly.

525
01:23:01,292 --> 01:23:03,860
It could be a girl.

526
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:08,799
- You kill people with that, do ya?
- Killed everyone I ever met out here.

527
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:11,469
Headshots, all of 'em.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

528
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,629
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.

529
01:23:18,008 --> 01:23:19,968
Come here.

530
01:23:27,117 --> 01:23:28,752
Take a peek.

531
01:23:28,852 --> 01:23:30,889
Seeds.

532
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,926
These are from home.
Heirlooms. The real thing.

533
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:38,630
- I plant one every chance I get.
- Where?

534
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:42,533
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

535
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:47,371
- So many different kinds.
- Trees, flowers, fruit.

536
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:49,441
Back then, everyone had their fill.

537
01:23:50,341 --> 01:23:53,735
Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.

538
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,618
Can I talk to you?

539
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:32,007
I've talked with the others.

540
01:24:37,888 --> 01:24:42,121
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

541
01:24:43,027 --> 01:24:47,478
If we leave the rig here and load
the motorcycles up with as much as we can,

542
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:50,934
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

543
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:55,773
One of those bikes is yours.

544
01:24:55,873 --> 01:24:58,410
Fully loaded.

545
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:03,084
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

546
01:25:06,617 --> 01:25:09,463
I'll... I'll make my own way.

547
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:18,270
You know, hope is a mistake.

548
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:27,529
If you can't fix
what's broken, you'll...

549
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:31,766
you'll go insane.

550
01:25:46,957 --> 01:25:49,984
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

551
01:25:50,828 --> 01:25:53,324
<i>Where are you?</i>

552
01:25:53,424 --> 01:25:56,292
- <i>Help us.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

553
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:09,451
<i>Come on, pa. Let's go.</i>

554
01:26:40,377 --> 01:26:42,422
All right.

555
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,716
This is your way home.

556
01:26:48,452 --> 01:26:50,620
We go back?

557
01:26:51,722 --> 01:26:53,724
- Back?
- Yeah.

558
01:26:53,824 --> 01:26:57,094
- I thought you weren't insane anymore.
- What are they saying?

559
01:26:57,194 --> 01:26:59,597
He wants to go back
from where they came.

560
01:26:59,697 --> 01:27:01,832
The Citadel.

561
01:27:01,932 --> 01:27:03,878
And what's there to find at The Citadel?

562
01:27:03,978 --> 01:27:06,671
- Green.
- And water.

563
01:27:08,071 --> 01:27:11,843
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water. And a lot of crops.

564
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:14,512
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.

565
01:27:14,612 --> 01:27:17,349
- Where does the water come from?
- He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

566
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:19,784
Calls it Aqua Cola
and claims it all for himself.

567
01:27:20,184 --> 01:27:22,320
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

568
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,955
I don't like him already.

569
01:27:24,055 --> 01:27:26,524
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.

570
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:31,579
No. I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

571
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,598
Through the canyon.

572
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:38,369
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

573
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:42,540
So we take the war rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

574
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,576
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.

575
01:27:45,676 --> 01:27:48,379
- Shut it off behind us.
- Kaboom!

576
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:56,054
And how exactly do we take The Citadel?
Assuming we're still alive by then?

577
01:27:56,554 --> 01:27:58,990
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

578
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:02,894
All that's left are his war pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

579
01:28:03,794 --> 01:28:07,304
And we'll be with Nux. He's a War Boy.

580
01:28:07,404 --> 01:28:10,092
He'll be bringing us home, bringing back
what's stolen, as he's meant to.

581
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:15,706
Yeah.

582
01:28:15,806 --> 01:28:17,833
It feels like hope.

583
01:28:18,642 --> 01:28:22,346
I like this plan. We can start again.

584
01:28:22,446 --> 01:28:25,212
Just like the old days.

585
01:28:25,683 --> 01:28:29,487
Look, it'll be a hard day.

586
01:28:29,787 --> 01:28:32,690
But I guarantee you
that 160 days ridin' that way,

587
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:37,101
there's nothin' but salt.

588
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:43,501
At least that way,
you know, we might be able to...

589
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:46,137
together...

590
01:28:46,937 --> 01:28:48,798
Come across some kind of redemption.

591
01:29:19,598 --> 01:29:23,152
War rig! That's the war rig!

592
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:35,887
- That's them.
- Why are they going back?

593
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,804
Do they wish to surrender?

594
01:29:38,904 --> 01:29:41,949
They are heading for the canyon.

595
01:29:42,093 --> 01:29:45,229
They're going back to The Citadel!

596
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:48,866
- They know it's undefended!
- Bullocks!

597
01:30:01,078 --> 01:30:02,338
Go!

598
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,470
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

599
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:29,698
- To who?
- Anyone that's listening.

600
01:30:53,597 --> 01:30:56,262
Here we go, girls!

601
01:30:57,101 --> 01:30:58,928
That's mine!

602
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,568
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.

603
01:31:12,116 --> 01:31:13,784
Don't blow my engine.

604
01:31:13,884 --> 01:31:16,678
I'm gonna nudge him. Just a little.

605
01:31:29,032 --> 01:31:31,894
You filth! You traitored him!

606
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:57,721
Go.

607
01:32:23,217 --> 01:32:27,491
Got to back off. Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

608
01:32:27,591 --> 01:32:29,192
Right.

609
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,995
Are you a black thumb?

610
01:32:31,095 --> 01:32:34,265
All right. Engine one now.
You and me, fifth wheel.

611
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:37,460
We'll unhook the tanker.

612
01:32:48,712 --> 01:32:51,398
One man, one bullet.

613
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:09,066
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

614
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,459
I cannot see.

615
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:54,669
Hey! Harpoons and plows!
They're hauling us back!

616
01:34:05,522 --> 01:34:08,450
Leave three bolts. Three.

617
01:35:25,936 --> 01:35:27,971
Hey, you!

618
01:35:42,919 --> 01:35:45,288
Are you okay?

619
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:49,651
I think she's hurt.

620
01:36:12,482 --> 01:36:13,553
Hey!

621
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:41,136
No!

622
01:36:50,294 --> 01:36:53,290
<i>Hey. Stay with me.</i>

623
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,159
- <i>Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

624
01:36:55,259 --> 01:36:56,818
Hey. Are you there?

625
01:36:58,029 --> 01:37:00,689
You finish that! I'll finish her!

626
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:32,380
Valhalla!

627
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:44,835
Oi!

628
01:39:12,562 --> 01:39:16,123
Engine one's good. For now.

629
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:06,355
She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!

630
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,943
You hear that?
We're gonna see two airborne V-8s.

631
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:44,080
I'm gonna need you to drive.

632
01:41:45,315 --> 01:41:47,528
I'll get him out of our way.

633
01:42:54,151 --> 01:42:56,401
Rictus!

634
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,678
Take me!

635
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:13,795
Cheedo! What are you doing?

636
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:19,533
No!

637
01:43:23,747 --> 01:43:25,762
Big boy!

638
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,281
Here! Here!

639
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,619
No!

640
01:44:27,177 --> 01:44:29,037
Remember me?

641
01:44:49,788 --> 01:44:52,727
He's dead! He's dead.

642
01:45:11,621 --> 01:45:15,325
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

643
01:45:15,425 --> 01:45:16,445
Come on!

644
01:45:17,658 --> 01:45:21,276
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

645
01:46:07,777 --> 01:46:10,371
Witness me.

646
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:18,308
Rictus!

647
01:47:12,475 --> 01:47:16,712
- Why is she making that noise?
- She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

648
01:47:16,812 --> 01:47:20,842
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.

649
01:47:26,322 --> 01:47:28,148
I know.

650
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,988
I am so sorry.

651
01:47:34,701 --> 01:47:36,975
I know. I know.

652
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:39,235
Hold it there.

653
01:47:39,335 --> 01:47:40,837
All right.

654
01:47:40,937 --> 01:47:43,439
Put that on there. Press it on.

655
01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:47,201
- Hey. Hey.
- Home.

656
01:47:54,517 --> 01:47:56,777
Home.

657
01:48:01,557 --> 01:48:03,184
No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

658
01:48:03,284 --> 01:48:05,859
She's exsanguinated.
Drained all her blood.

659
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,360
Hold these.

660
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:12,536
We need that. Thank you. Needle.

661
01:48:13,536 --> 01:48:15,418
Come on!

662
01:48:15,891 --> 01:48:17,911
Take this.

663
01:48:19,794 --> 01:48:21,186
Keep her awake.

664
01:48:21,286 --> 01:48:22,437
Furiosa.

665
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:28,952
Okay, that's not retracting.

666
01:48:29,052 --> 01:48:31,220
There we go.

667
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,205
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

668
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:36,238
Okay.

669
01:48:36,338 --> 01:48:38,383
Sorry.

670
01:48:39,195 --> 01:48:42,156
There you go. Okay. There you go.

671
01:48:54,277 --> 01:48:55,545
Max.

672
01:48:56,834 --> 01:48:59,339
My name is Max.

673
01:49:06,989 --> 01:49:09,516
That's my name.

674
01:49:50,533 --> 01:49:52,490
Brake!

675
01:49:57,106 --> 01:49:59,691
Reveal yourself.

676
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,619
He's got something.

677
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:26,955
It's Immortan Joe.

678
01:50:27,055 --> 01:50:30,028
The Immortan Joe is dead!

679
01:50:56,132 --> 01:50:58,301
Furiosa!

680
01:51:02,538 --> 01:51:03,707
Furiosa!

681
01:51:04,107 --> 01:51:06,543
She's back.

682
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:18,579
Let's do it! Let 'em up. Come on.
